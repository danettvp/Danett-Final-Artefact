# Danett – Final Artefact  

## Final Artefact  
The final artefact is an interactive website that explores the emotional and playful side of letter writing in a digital context. It focuses on creating a casual and inviting experience that encourages users to write freely through short prompts, making the act of writing feel less formal and more personal.  

## Limitations  
In **index.html**, only the custom cursor interaction was developed and tested to explore how subtle motion can influence engagement.  

In **choose.html**, **GSAP** was implemented to prototype a smooth transition between writing prompts, experimenting with how animation could make the interaction feel more fluid and playful.  

While both pages demonstrate the intended direction of the experience, future iterations would focus on refining functionality, improving responsiveness, and integrating all interactive components into a fully connected prototype.
